/* java variable
you have 5 types of varibles in java 
boolean- true/false only 2 states
integers- Int, always numbers a;ways whole
strings- Text, ex, "hello" always in quotation
floats - always decimal 19.999
char- single characters, "a", "n" write a code that gives you how many characters are in the longest word in english (insert word here)

in math you say x=4 it means 4=x
in programming x=4 means 4 is assigned to x in x i can assign anythng i want to x
i really like this class

x="patty"
b="tomato"
c="cheese"
d="bread"
e="lettuce"
f="ketchup"
g="mayo"

so the template:type variable=value;
